# MacroTool
A tool that aids in creating Macro Scripts that are dynamic, as well as takes in prerendered scripts encased in custom tags to load as common responses to categories. This is meant as an offline webtool, with nothing saving, or pointing away from the webpage. Everything is mechanical and non-proprietary as per names of classes pertaining to any client work that this may be used with.
